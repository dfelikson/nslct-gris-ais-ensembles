Trial 1:
- ice temperature from Nias
- initial guess (md.friction.coefficient) from Nias
- dirichlet BCs on land-terminating ice (v = v_obs)
- neumann BCs on ocean-terminating ice

- cost_function_coefficients same as Nias
- md.friction.coupling = 0

Trial 2:
- ice temperature from Choi (HO run)

Trial 3:
- neumann BCs everywhere (ocean- and land-terminating ice)

Trial 4:
- Initial guess ... md.friction.coefficient = 30
